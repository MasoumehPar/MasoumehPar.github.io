# Hiring challenge

The code can be run in platforms that support Python ( for example Jupyter or Pycharm).
To create the dashboard you can follow these steps:
1) Download the .xlsx file and Challenge_final.py to a project folder on your computer. 
2) Change the path of the data file (.xlsx) in the code to the path on your computer. 
3) Run the code. To run the code you might need to download some of the libraries that are used in the code (numpy, pandas, plotly, dash). To download these libraries use 'pip install [name of the library]' on the terminal of the platform you are using.
4) By running the code a link will be produced. Click on the produced link to load the dashboard.
